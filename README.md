A team of 5 of us has created an e-ticketing platform specifically for buses in the Toba area. The user interface (front-end) is developed with Vue.js, while the server-side logic (back-end) is powered by Laravel. We are using MySQL as our database solution, and the user interface was designed using Figma.
